            <h2> My name is Abdullah and living the simple life saved my life </h2> 
            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved , but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p> 
            <p>Things were terrible . I had a job that I hated , a home that I didn't want to Live in , and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p> 
            <h3>How I turned things around </h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything </strong>. I literally put 98 % of my possessions in the garbage , sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment , and I quit my job.</p> 
            <p> It wasn't easy at all , but everything around me was in such a bad place , 1 didn't know what else to do . And it worked . </p> 
            <h3> Now I live the simple life </h3> 
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life , things are so much better . I'm less stressed , enjoy life and work mare , and I have more free time to enjoy .</p> <p>with how much it turned my life around , <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well , which is why I started this site! </p>
